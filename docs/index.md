# Hey there! :wave:

I'm Jack Guo, a frontend engineer who loves :basketball:, :snowboarder:, :video_game:, and :drum:.

This is my learning corner where I document my learning, and I would like to share my knowledge and resources with the community. Hopefully, you'll find something useful here! :grin:
